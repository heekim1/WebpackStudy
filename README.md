# ng-webpack-starter-seed

Minimal starter seed for AngularJS and Webpack.

Most of the started seed templates come with proprietary project structure. It doesn't help you get started quickly.
This starter seed precisely solve that problem. Often we need a starter seed so that we can just start hacking without having to understand the project structure.

With this seed, all the conde needs to be placed in `/src` folder. That's it.

#### To get started

- Clone this repo
> git clone https://github.com/adityaparab/ng-webpack-starter-seed.git

- cd to `ng-webpack-starter-seed`
> cd ng-webpack-starter-seed

> npm run dev

`npm run dev` will first install all the required modules and start webpack-dev-server at 8080. Change any file and see the changes reflected in browser.

To buid the project and get output run `npm start`
> npm start

The output will be found in`./dist` folder
